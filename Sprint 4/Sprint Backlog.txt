Paragraph Explanation:
As this is the last full-length sprint we have (sprint 5 is shorter), we felt it was important to have almost all of our product backlog on our sprint backlog. Major aspects left that we wish to prioritize are adding (by both dialog and csv) and removing stock functionality as well as graph functionality with robust working acceptance tests as key. We also want to focus on creating a feasibility report for the first feature requirement. We also are prioritizing security by completing the SSL requirement as well as timed lockout of login after failing to log in three times. Based on feedback from the Sprint 3 review, we added changing the background color of homepage as an aesthetic update.
